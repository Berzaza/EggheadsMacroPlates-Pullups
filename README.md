# Disclaimer: I have the right to stop updating this whenever I want, though I will probably update it for a while longer.<br />
# Also in the scripts current state you have to press L to exit it each time you stop a macro or it wont work, I will be fixing this soon.<br />
# Eggheads Macro<br />
An Ahk Macro for visionism<br />
Must have AutoHotKey Version 1 for this to work<br />
Sadly graphics design is not my passion so you just have to live with the shitty gui<br />

# Instructions:<br />
 Once downloaded open the file and open the exe, this should show a gui from there just click on whatever you want to do<br />
 when clicking on start macro for weights and treads you just have to be within enough range to see the prompt to get on and it will work<br />
 for strike speed just be within enough range to hit the bag and buy the thing then hover your mouse over it and press k<br />

# Keybinds:<br />
 for the most part its just clicking on the gui but with strikings you have to press k when hovering over the training<br />
 also you can press L to close the entire macro<br />
