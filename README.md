# Eggheads Macro
An Ahk Macro for visionism
Must have AutoHotKey Version 1 for this to work
Disclaimer: I have the right to stop updating this whenever I want, though I will probably update it for a little while longer.

Instructions:
 Once downloaded open the file and open the exe, this should show a gui from there just click on whatever you want to do
 when clicking on start macro for weights and treads you just have to be within enough range to see the prompt to get on and it will work
 for strike speed just be within enough range to hit the bag and buy the thing then hover your mouse over it and press k

Keybinds:
 for the most part its just clicking on the gui but with strikings you have to press k when hovering over the training
 also you can press L to close the entire macro
